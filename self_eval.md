# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I find comparison operators pretty easy as long as I have them written down next to me and what exactly they mean
and after a couple of times of doing them it's pretty easy to understand.
2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Logical operators are a bit more complex they lead on as if they're going to be easy but then you 
actually have to think about them which throws me off a bit but once I'm in a groove they're pretty easy. 
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
If statements for me I think are the easiest as long as I pay attention to what code I'm writing and what 
questions I'm answering. 
4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I think the amount of time I spent this really only added up to an hour.
5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I could probably still practice all of and by doing that I will probably work on doing the exercises again. 
I don't think I will need to adjust my calendar to do so.
6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I wouldn't say I have many questions just need to play around and experiment.
